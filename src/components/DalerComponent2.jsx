          <p>
            The right to freedom of expression is particularly important in an
            environment where in social media platforms use algorithms that
            decide whose voices we hear. In 2014, researchers from Cornell
            collaborated with Facebook to undertake an emotional-contagion
            study, examining how emotions spread through the social network. The
            researchers manipulated the experience of almost 700,000 Facebook
            users by using a sentiment analysis tool to identify if friends
            posted negative comments or posts. Those negative posts were then
            removed from users’ newsfeeds to test whether algorithmically
            skewing the feed to display positive posts would keep users on the
            site longer.44 This study demonstrates how platforms can make
            decisions based on users’ expressions that cause the world to appear
            in certain ways, strengthening one reality while weakening
            another.45

            The right to freedom of expression is a cornerstone of fundamental
            human rights found in Article 19 of both the Universal Declaration
            and the ICCPR.46

            As social media platforms become the central place where public
            discussion happens, there is a strong debate about the role of
            platforms in content moderation.47 With hate speech, false news, and
            media manipulation circulating on platforms like Facebook and
            Twitter, legislators and the public are calling for companies to
            address the problem.

          <p>
            These calls to action are met with concerns about how private
            companies can meaningfully determine the boundaries of speech. For
            example, David Kaye, the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to
            freedom of opinion and expression, has expressed concern that
            content moderation systems could, even unintentionally, censor
            minority opinions and other unpopular yet critical forms of free
            expression.48 The NYU’s Center for Business and Human Rights argues
            for more governance of technology platforms but states that
            government intervention can also do harm.49
          </p>
          <p>
            The resource-intensive and relentless task of content moderation
            requires making difficult decisions on both standards and their
            subsequent application. Kaye goes on to indicate that in this murky
            environment, putting human rights at the center of this debate
            offers states, companies, and key stakeholders practical standards
            to guide content regulation, which would also apply when deploying
            automated systems.50 While this report cannot delve far into this
            contentious issue,51 it is important to note that a human rights
            perspective informs us that few human rights are absolute. The
            decisions about tradeoffs involve questions around proportionality,
            that is, balancing the legal and social impact relative to multiple
            rights. A rights-based frame offers language to analyze the balance
            between the right to the freedom of expression with rights and
            freedoms such as political participation, information, assembly,
            association, privacy, and security.
