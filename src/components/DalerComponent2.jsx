                        The right to freedom of expression is particularly important in an environment where in social media platforms use algorithms that decide whose voices we hear. In 2014, researchers from Cornell collaborated with Facebook to undertake an emotional-contagion study, examining how emotions spread through the social network. The researchers manipulated the experience of almost 700,000 Facebook users by using a sentiment analysis tool to identify if friends posted negative comments or posts. Those negative posts were then removed from users’ newsfeeds to test whether algorithmically skewing the feed to display positive posts would keep users on the site longer.44 This study demonstrates how platforms can make decisions based on users’ expressions that cause the world to appear in certain ways, strengthening one reality while weakening another.45

                        The right to freedom of expression is a cornerstone of fundamental human rights found in Article 19 of both the Universal Declaration and the ICCPR.46

                        As social media platforms become the central place where public discussion happens, there is a strong debate about the role of platforms in content moderation.47 With hate speech, false news, and media manipulation circulating on platforms like Facebook and Twitter, legislators and the public are calling for companies to address the problem.

                        These calls to action are met with concerns about how private companies can meaningfully determine the boundaries of speech. For example, David Kaye, the UN’s special rapporteur on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, has expressed concern that content moderation systems could, even unintentionally, censor minority opinions and other unpopular yet critical forms of free expression.48 The NYU’s Center for Business and Human Rights argues for more governance of technology platforms but states that government intervention can also do harm.49

                        The resource-intensive and relentless task of content moderation requires making difficult decisions on both standards and their subsequent application. Kaye goes on to indicate that in this murky environment, putting human rights at the center of this debate offers states, companies, and key stakeholders practical standards to guide content regulation, which would also apply when deploying automated systems.50
                        While this report cannot delve far into this contentious issue,51 it is important to note that a human rights perspective informs us that few human rights are absolute. The decisions about tradeoffs involve questions around proportionality, that is, balancing the legal and social impact relative to multiple rights. A rights-based frame offers language to analyze the balance between the right to the freedom of expression with rights and freedoms such as political participation, information, assembly, association, privacy, and security.
